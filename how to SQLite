go to your project directory and type 'sqlite3 databasename.db'. This will create a new database - database.db.
Then you can type '.databases' and it will show all open databases. You'll probably see only database.db there.
To exit sqlite, type '.quit' or '.exit'
If you wanna access an already made database file, you'll have to start with typing 'sqlite3'
Then type '.open path/to/DBname.db'. It will be enough to write the path as just './DBname.db'
(We're not done yet! Now type '.attach database "path/to/DBname.db" as DBname'.) Actually, maybe you can do without this one, .open is enough by itself, lulz!
NOW you'll be able to insert tables in it, look what's in it etc.
DON'T FORGET to put a ; in the end of each statement, SQLite is crazy about them. Ironically, I didn't put them in my example statements above.
Type '.tables' to see all tables in current database.

INSERT INTO table VALUES( value1,    value2 ,...);
